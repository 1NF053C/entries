[4:53 pm, 29/05/2024] Chris: My phone screen decided to turn off permanently so I had to get replacement. Can I get some help from one of you to get access to my chat history here? Need to screen share so I can record for my notes
[4:55 pm, 29/05/2024] Chris: - Google meets has screen share
- need one person to vid chat me and hit share screen, open this group and scroll from top to bottom.

Will help me with career counseling progress.
[12:29 am, 30/05/2024] Chris: I poked/chatted contact of micro intership who said they're interested in following up with me for their gig.
[12:32 am, 30/05/2024] Chris: I sent my availability for a video interview with IT/Temp jobs team at a University.
[12:34 am, 30/05/2024] Chris: I pushed a couple updates to https://compassionandhardwork.com/changelog.html
[12:34 am, 30/05/2024] Chris: I connected with (LinkedIn) and reached out to one senior IT acquaintance who left VG and suggested we video chat.
[6:18 am, 30/05/2024] Chris: I requested a mock interview with Penn State career service contact.
[6:35 am, 30/05/2024] Chris: I painted a door for my dad.
[7:04 am, 30/05/2024] Chris: I retrieved and organized tools for my dad.
[3:58 pm, 30/05/2024] Chris: I requested a mock interview with Cassie from PSU Alumni career services and shared the upcoming screening/interview details with her. Cassie shared a mock interview date and said it is with her colleague Holly Stoltzfus, who has availability.
[4:12 pm, 30/05/2024] Chris: I responded to message/opportunity on parker Dewey app to see if they had availability to talk tomorrow, since their suggested time slots to talk in a few days didn't work with my work hours.
[5:49 pm, 30/05/2024] Chris: I responded to another opportunity on Parker Dewey app, this one for SEO and PPC Management for SEO firm's web app.
[9:05 pm, 30/05/2024] Chris: I followed up with a lionlink job poster to let him know about my phone replacement and that I have my normal number again. This guy added me on LinkedIn a few days ago, no conversation though.
[10:26 am, 31/05/2024] Chris: I applied to an engineering support gig on PSU's lionlink people grove platform.
[11:09 am, 31/05/2024] Chris: I applied to a 2nd engineering support role on PSU lionlink people grove platform.
[11:10 am, 31/05/2024] Chris: I switched calendar from proton to Google calendar, its easier to share with others.
[1:34 pm, 31/05/2024] Chris: I had a catch-up call with my previous manager Jon Presson (App Eng II role).
[4:02 pm, 31/05/2024] Chris: U of Colorado rejected my Student-Athlete Academic Support Services Intern Application
[1:39 pm, 01/06/2024] Chris: I somehow have 3pm to 4pm marked as busy for today on my gcal. I don't know what the event was for. Lol.
[1:40 pm, 01/06/2024] Chris: At work, our truck delivery was delayed from 11am to 2:30/3:00pm so I'll likely be busy during that time.
[7:21 pm, 03/06/2024] Chris: I had mock interview counseling with head of university park alumni services, Holly today. It was constructive and I have a number of action items to follow up on too.
[10:09 am, 04/06/2024] Chris: I did a phone screen with UVA. I need to find 5 references, two of which were managers in the next 24 hours who are willing to fill out the form (as an individual not representing a company).
[10:13 am, 04/06/2024] Chris: I was selected for a micro internship thru Penn State platform.
[10:32 am, 04/06/2024] Cody: What's a micro internship
[1:24 pm, 04/06/2024] Chris: Short term gig for cash. Like 40 hours work for $600. Not a bad structure if it actually works tbh, haven't done a gig yet tho.
[1:29 pm, 04/06/2024] Chris: I reached out to two coworkers that came to mind. Have to reach out to a 3rd and 2 managers.
[1:30 pm, 04/06/2024] Chris: I left my number at Atillis Gym in OCNJ a 2nd time to try to offer my time in early AM or in between Walgreens shifts. They said they want the help.
[1:31 pm, 04/06/2024] Chris: I pushed more updates to my personal website.
[7:13 pm, 04/06/2024] Chris: Unfortunately 99% of my experience has been with vanguard and the above has been the response whenever I ask for references.
[7:13 pm, 04/06/2024] Chris: I called external HR number as well and they tell me it's not within their policy to share my performance reviews externally.

My performance reviews contain feedback from all of my managers saying that I exceeded expectations in terms of technical prowess, and willingness to learn and collaborate with other people.

If there is some way we could legally get access to those perf reviews I think that would help me but yeah I'm not sure exactly what to do. I had short stint at startup and a couple customer service roles but they represent like 1% of my experiences so it doesn't make sense to give those references weight tbh.
[10:02 am, 05/06/2024] Chris: The references portal updated to say I wasn't in the process any more. I sent an email to Emma the UVA contact to request more time.
[10:08 am, 05/06/2024] Chris: Emma said I'm good with more time and that there is no time limit.
[10:36 am, 05/06/2024] Chris: As of today it's been 7 years since I started working at Vanguard. Financial companies are only required to keep digital records for 7 years.
[10:41 am, 05/06/2024] Chris: "it is our policy to require at least two responses for your candidate profile. It can be anyone who has been a manager, mentor, teacher, supervisor to you" Emma clarified that the requirements are actually much more lax.
[11:44 pm, 06/06/2024] Chris: I decided not to move forward with the micro internship gig.
[12:14 pm, 07/06/2024] Chris: (For good reasons)
[11:56 am, 08/06/2024] Chris: Besides the Uber account, someone seemed to sign up for an insta shopper account under an email that isn't mine. This is on my temp phone:
[11:56 am, 08/06/2024] Chris: Besides the Uber account, someone seemed to sign up for an insta shopper account under an email that isn't mine. This is on my temp phone:
[4:08 pm, 09/06/2024] Chris: Advice: My Walgreens manager updates schedules in 3 different locations in the store (two printed and one digitally), and gives verbal updates like once (Chris can you work on the 10th and day ABC at XYZ o clock), and then later gives ambiguous updates (Chris the schedule has been updated as of the 20th... And as of the 12th... Etc), but now all three schedules are conflicting.

When I asked for clarification before on schedule her response was "we discussed that Chris".

I can ask for what the single source of truth is but since she's updating the schedule at different times they each are partially accurate.
[4:08 pm, 09/06/2024] Chris: How can I respectfully resolve this kind of communication opportunity?
[4:18 pm, 09/06/2024] Greg Liptak: Definitely depends on what kind of working relationship you have with her but near term you need to word it in a way where you can get 'I've checked the 3 locations' (done your due diligence) and 'They don't agree' (she needs to provide a solution) in before she can be dismissive of you. Hopefully that can lead you to a constructive discussion on when and where should you expect updates. But if she's a pain it's possible she won't take responsibility for confusion regardless. If you have email or use text, doing it by that would be useful if she ever chose to write you up in the future due to missing a poorly conveyed schedule you'll at least have coverage to go above her and say it was ambiguous.
[4:29 pm, 09/06/2024] Chris: Thank you. I've done a version of this over text. I thanked her for the opportunity hours and pointed out the three disagreeing locations and asked if she'd like me to remind her if the digital location was yet to be updated.
[5:57 pm, 09/06/2024] Chris: I've added one reference to the skillsurvey link for UVA form. It may restrict me from sending it without 5 total. I asked UVA recruiter what I should do if it doesn't let me share after I add the second, since they said I only need to submit 2, not 5.
[6:08 pm, 09/06/2024] Chris: I chatted with an intashopper support agent to get the fake gmail removed and the actual one added. They didn't send a follow up email yet but said it would be taken care of by another team.
[6:10 pm, 09/06/2024] Chris: I talked to an old security architect I knew from Vanguard and he suggested I get newer android phone and mentioned potential sim swapping risk.
[6:14 pm, 09/06/2024] Chris: It could also just be leftover from old phone number that I reused maybe but that doesn't explain the signup form logic and how it asked me to put in my full name and then called me by a different name üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[6:18 pm, 09/06/2024] Chris: I followed up with another instashopper support agent , lmao
[6:21 pm, 09/06/2024] Chris: used email lip***gre***@gmail.com
[12:43 pm, 11/06/2024] Chris: I've submitted the references form so you should get these links.
[12:44 pm, 11/06/2024] Chris: I included Professor Ed Glantz as a reference.
[9:14 pm, 12/06/2024] Chris: üôèthx again greg
[1:21 am, 13/06/2024] Greg Liptak: Got the reference survey done
[1:21 am, 13/06/2024] Greg Liptak: Good luck, hope it comes thru for ya
[6:43 am, 13/06/2024] Chris: Thank u
[1:32 pm, 13/06/2024] Chris: Reference report finalized ‚úÖ
[1:45 pm, 18/06/2024] Chris: I got notification of temp job position with UVA
[3:39 pm, 18/06/2024] Greg Liptak: Nice dude! Hope it serves as a springboard to something full time
[3:44 pm, 18/06/2024] Cody: Noice!
[12:45 pm, 10/07/2024] Chris: Published my first Reactjs component https://npmjs.org/@1nf053c/mapbox-map
[9:54 am, 11/07/2024] Chris: Well I was able to write a script that spun up a container, run some compute within that container instance, bind a host directory, and copy only the JavaScript package files I needed to the host file system. This way of development may help web developer work on app features while being more certain about how they're impacting their operating system.
[9:56 am, 11/07/2024] Chris: Now my task is to stand by this ladder for my dad until he comes back lol
[12:09 pm, 11/07/2024] Cody: Lol
[12:09 pm, 11/07/2024] Cody: Classic
[12:09 pm, 11/07/2024] Cody: Getting through some mundane work today myself
[12:09 pm, 11/07/2024] Cody: Maybe not quite as bad as watching a ladder though üòÖ
[12:09 pm, 11/07/2024] Cody: You got dis
[12:11 pm, 11/07/2024] Cody: Ironically the headspace app yesterday gave me a spiel about there being magic in the mundane
[1:58 pm, 11/07/2024] Chris: magic?
[3:37 pm, 11/07/2024] Cody: Magic.
[5:58 pm, 15/07/2024] Chris: Applied to a project manager job on LinkedIn and updated my project list to include three more items. That wasn't fun but it's good to have a few more things to talk about.
[5:57 pm, 24/07/2024] Chris: - created and published an apptainer nodejs prisma SQL starter repo to GitHub.
[8:01 pm, 24/07/2024] Chris: Applied to a Project Management role, remote.
[10:13 am, 25/07/2024] Chris: Applied to another Project Management role.
[11:00 am, 04/08/2024] Chris: Applied to Tesla and a couple other places on LinkedIn
[11:01 am, 04/08/2024] Chris: I didn't update you guys re: the last 2-4
[12:05 pm, 05/08/2024] Chris: https://linkedin.com/in/christopher-dillinger

Shared latest code commits to LinkedIn
[1:29 pm, 09/08/2024] Chris: Applied to a job thru connection from dad/Jim tegler. Company called "quecon" who apparently do contracts for FAA.
[1:34 pm, 09/08/2024] Chris: I applied to a junior project management position on LinkedIn yesterday.
[1:35 pm, 09/08/2024] Chris: I followed up on an application on USAjobs.gov to Smithsonian institute which didn't have an app status.
[1:36 pm, 09/08/2024] Chris: The provided contact email with @si.edu address returned an access denied message.
[1:37 pm, 09/08/2024] Chris: I took a screenshot and sent Gmail to Uncle Jrs Gmail and he texted and said the screenshot didn't go through for him.
[1:38 pm, 09/08/2024] Chris: Applied to another .gov job yesterday.
[1:43 pm, 09/08/2024] Chris: I did buy/download the Project+ Guide that I used to help me earn my PM cert in 2023. It's not something I have memorized but its nice to have as an available reference/recipe.
[1:52 pm, 09/08/2024] Chris: Yesterday I wrote some commands and Docker compose file for Docker containers to:
- Pull a DB image and app image from docker hub
- Create a local docker network and volume
- Run the containers with a few DB and Springboot variables/values.

One thing I learned:
- Both Docker and Apptainer support something called the Open Container Initiative (OCI) which means I could convert one Docker image to an Apptainer image (SIF) if I wanted or needed to.
[5:51 pm, 09/08/2024] Chris: Oops I meant Dad - not Jim T. Jim T provided a different connection.
[5:53 pm, 09/08/2024] Chris: Send out 600+ apps in a couple years and you'll start to mix things up haha
