purpose:
  Improve API platform reliability

safely:
  To improve API platform reliability safely I started by generating synthetic HTTP traffic in a non-production environment.
  This allowed the team to gain confidence that the API Gateway instance could handle a certain amount of HTTP traffic while maintaining expected levels of availability.
  Requested pull request reviews and approvals from teammates and leads.

summary: |
  Defined Service Level Indicator and Objective definitions for API Gateway HTTP messages by working with peers, reading SRE workbook, and decided on latency, error, and volume metric definitions.
  Implemented and deployed synthetic http traffic generation by creating Amazon Cloudwatch Events Lambda functions that sent HTTP messages through the API gateway on an interval.
  Implemented custom Apigee edge microgateway logging plugin to send log events to splunk systems.
  Implemented splunk dashboards and panels to display status of Service Level Indicators, Service Level Objectives.
