materials:
  - Jira Admin Documentation
  - Confluence Admin Documentation
  - Internal knowledge guides

Purpose:
  To give other platform engineers more time to work on mission critial tasks and to learn about the kind of confusion that customers had.

Safely:
  To accomplish this safely, I asked clarifying questions to better understand differences between actual field of use and expected field of use for confluence, jira, and API Gateway.
  I documented as much of my work as I could within help tickets so that there was a papertrail of troubleshooting steps and took care to follow advice from more senior administrators who performed support work before me.

Summary: |
  Supported API Economy team and Build and Run team by resolving client support requests.
  Administered new confluence work spaces, new jira projects and workflows, and answered technical questions.
  Created and improved internal knowledge documentation.
