safely: |
  I implemented and tested features in non-production environments, and held pull-request reviews with teammate.

summary: |
  With support of management and peers within the company, I led the implementation of a "Technical Achievement Framework" webapp, using React.js, TypeScript, GraphQL, Node.js, and an internal continuous integration / continuous delivery pipeline.
  I held weekly status meetings on Microsoft Teams to gather interest and volunteer help.
  I interviewed 60 engineers so I could gather their opinions and critcisms when first using the app.
  To streamline the onboarding process, I implemented an interactive tour feature that walked engineers through the available features on the webapp.
  To streamline the feedback gathering process, I implemented a wrapper component which allowed users to click on any feature in the webapp and send me an email with their feedback.
