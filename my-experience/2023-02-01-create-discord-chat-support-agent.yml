safely:
  Before starting work, I asked my client clarifying questions related to his expectations in terms of features, budget and timeline. Then, during development I created test markdown files in a directory and generated output files that I delivered to my client along with the program source code. This provided both myself and the client confidence that the program met the specified requirements.

summary: |
  Implemented a Discord Cyber Scenario, Quiz, And Cyber Awareness Training Bot from pseudo code and quiz data files.
  Architected code into modular components by separating main controller logic from backing API services.
