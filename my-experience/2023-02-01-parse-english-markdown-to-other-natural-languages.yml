purpose:
  To enable a client to reach a wider website audience by offering non-english pages of their website.

safely:
  Before starting work, I asked my client clarifying questions related to his expectations in terms of features, budget and timeline. Then, during development I created test markdown files in a directory and generated output files that I delivered to my client along with the program source code. This provided both myself and the client confidence that the program met the specified requirements.

summary: |
  Implemented parser to translate static website markdown content to other natural languages, using Node.js, language grammar concepts, a javascript-based parser generator library, OpenAI API and DeepL API.
  Produced test fixtures to demonstrate that the program generated expected files.
  Received feedback from client that they were satisfied with the work and that they'd recommend other clients work with me.
