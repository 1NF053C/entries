purpose:
  To show activity information in the tenant suite view and to allow the release team to control when the feature was enabled in production.

safely: |
  I tested this component in non-production environments and then involved teammates to get their approval as well.
  This involved coordinating changes with teammates and opening a pull request to gather approvals from team members and leads prior to elevating the feature into production, and verifying the team's feature toggle release process.

summary: |
  Updated Dottid's active suite Reactjs UI component to display tenant suite activity and enabled a Launch Darkly feature toggle integration.
  Tested the feature in non-production, requested a pull-requrest review process from teammates and gathered approvals for production elevation.
